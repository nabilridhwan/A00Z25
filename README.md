## What is A00Z25 or A0Z25
> A0Z25 or A00Z25 is a modification of the A1Z26 cipher. Each letter corresponds to a number. So for example: A corresponds with 00, B corresponds with 01 and so on, till Z corresponds with 25. Hence the name A00Z25.

## How about numbers and symbols?
> Numbers and symbols (including spaces) are completely ignored. For example:
```
"HELLOWORLD" would encode into "07041111142214171103"
"HELLO WORLD" would still encode into "07041111142214171103" which decodes to "HELLOWORLD"
"H3DD0 W0R1D" would encode into "070303221703" which decodes to "HDDWRD"
